<p>Page Not Found !</p>

<!--go to app-routing.module.ts
here we have handle error url using wildcard routes.
wildcard routes : {path:'**',component:Wildcarredirectroute15Component}
but after implementing wildcard route, base url also display page not found 
wildcard component. so we need to handle it for base url.
{path:'',redirectTo:'/departments',pathMatch:"full"},//redirecting route
so for base url '' we are redirecting to /departments url-->
